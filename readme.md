## 📚 What I Learned

During this bootcamp, I gained practical knowledge and built full-stack applications using the MERN stack. Below are the core concepts covered:

### 🧠 Frontend (React.js)
- JSX, Components, Props & State
- Functional & Class Components
- React Router (SPA Navigation)
- API Integration using `fetch` and `axios`
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Conditional Rendering and Lists
- Form Handling & Validation

### 🔧 Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
- Setting up Express server
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Middleware and Routing
- Error Handling
- Environment Variables & Security Best Practices
- Authentication using JWT

### 🗄️ Database (MongoDB)
- CRUD Operations with MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM for schema definition and validation
- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB Atlas
- Data Modeling and Relationships

### 🧩 Full Stack Integration
- Connecting Frontend and Backend
- End-to-End CRUD Functionality
- State Management with Context API
- Authentication Flow (Login, Register)
- Deployment using services like Vercel / Render / MongoDB Atlas

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Proficiency in building real-world full-stack web apps
- Clear understanding of REST APIs and client-server architecture
- Strong command over React component-driven development
- Experience in managing asynchronous operations and backend logic
- Knowledge of deployment strategies for production-ready apps
